# Shuddho Sharaf's Wall

This repository contains all the contents from my website.

## Why do I call myself ‘Prolhad’?

Just because I want to. I found this word in a Bangla Dictionary, and it basically
means "joy".

## What are my topics of interest?

Mostly computer stuff and literature.

## Why this website?

I always feel the need to jot down my ideas.
That's why, I decided to come up with my own website, where I can experiment and
get creative with my thoughts.

## Why this explanation?

Because, my thoughts are perpendicular to the normal.

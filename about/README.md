# About Me

I'm a clueless idiot, lurking around the web every once in a while. I've had passion for programming. It can be doubted that I still have it. What I can't doubt is the fact that I love computers. Computers always give me the "You're not alone!" feels, and they have always been by my side whenever I needed someone to fix me up.

On this website, I'll primarily be sharing whatever I find useful for myself. If you're interested, you're welcome to explore.

And you're always invited to visit my [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/prolhad)

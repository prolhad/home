# Shuddho Sharaf

Welcome!

I don't know why or how you are here but I'm glad!

You can checkout my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuddhosharaf)** in case you want a formal introduction.

Otherwise, I'm just someone who likes to put his experiments on **[GitHub](https://github.com/sudo318)**.

If you know me, that's great!

If you don't, just remember me as **Sudo**. :floppy_disk:
